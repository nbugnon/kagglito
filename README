Models added
no db:migrate etc

As I understand, scafolding is incopatible with ActiveRecord (DB relatioships) and some tutorials discourage it
as a production tool. I guess a good way to use scaffolds is branching in git and creating them to look at them 
as examples.


The model is relatively simple:

1)We treat The training stage and the testing stage as 2 distinct competitions
2)AnnotatedChalenge : a pair of BLOBs with a question and its ideal responce
3)Dataset: a grouping of Annotated Chalenges +description
4)Evaluator: ruby source code that evaluates the distance beetween a submission and the annotated chalenge 
	many distances can be implemented in a simgle Evaluator
5)Competition: a Dataset + an evaluator
6)User: a person that can participate in competitions
7)Submission: the responce of a person to a chalenge in a particular competition

particular case in the model:
In the relationship Competition<->User we have two distinct relasionships 
1)To participate in a competition 
2)To host/create a Competition
It is discouraged to use active record to implement both
A very simple solution would be to create a diferent model for the administrator


Desired fonctionality:

User subscription to the service and to the competions

Insert a dataset (and its respective AnnotatedChalenges) as a zip file (maybe not in rails)
Create two datasets by spliting randomly a dataset
Create a dataset by merging two others
Create Dataset by removing AnnotatedChalenges from datasets

Create competions

Mail notifications 




in ./vendor two scripts contain the rails commands that create the models and the 
scaffolds for our ER model

in ./vendor is also a ruby file to deal with the BLOB->image isues (for the evaluator)

for the moment the gems used 'narray' 'RMagick' 'imageruby-bmp'
